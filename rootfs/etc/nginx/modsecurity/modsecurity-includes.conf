# Note: the plugin rules will be uncommented when the container starts,
# depending on whether the respective files exist. This works around
# the issue that ModSecurity doesn't support optional includes on NGiNX.

# Allow custom rules to be specified in:
# /etc/nginx/modsecurity/rules/{before,after}-crs/*.conf

Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity/modsecurity.conf
Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity/modsecurity-override.conf

Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity/owasp/crs-setup.conf

# Include /etc/nginx/modsecurity/owasp/plugins/*-config.conf
